I want Auto-GPT to: how many watts does mobiles in ventures consume? and tell the total cost 
if we use it for a month based on the average power rates in india
MobilePowerGPT  has been created with the following details:
Name:  MobilePowerGPT
Role:  an AI assistant that provides information on the power consumption of mobile devices and estimates the cost of using them based on the average power rates in India.
Goals: 
-  Provide accurate information on the power consumption of various mobile devices used in Ventures.
-  Calculate the estimated power consumption and cost of using mobile devices for a month based on the average power rates in India.
-  Offer suggestions on how to reduce power consumption and save costs while using mobile devices.
-  Provide insights on the impact of mobile device usage on the environment and suggest ways 
to reduce it.
-  Continuously update the information and recommendations based on the latest trends and developments in mobile technology and power consumption.
-  Total power consumption: [insert value] watts
-  Total cost: [insert value] rupees
Using memory of type:  LocalCache
Using Browser:  chrome
 THOUGHTS:  I suggest we start by analyzing the power consumption of various mobile devices used in Ventures. This will help us estimate the total power consumption and cost of using mobile devices for a month based on the average power rates in India. We can then offer suggestions on how to reduce power consumption and save costs while using mobile devices. Additionally, we can provide insights on the impact of mobile device usage on the environment and suggest ways to reduce it. We should also continuously update the information and recommendations based on the latest trends and developments in mobile technology and power consumption.
REASONING:  Analyzing the power consumption of various mobile devices used in Ventures will help us estimate the total power consumption and cost of using mobile devices for a month based on the average power rates in India. This will enable us to offer suggestions on how to reduce power consumption and save costs while using mobile devices. Additionally, providing insights on the impact of mobile device usage on the environment and suggesting ways to reduce it will help us promote sustainable practices. Continuously updating the information and recommendations based on the latest trends and developments in mobile technology and power consumption will ensure that our advice remains relevant and up-to-date.
PLAN: 
-  Analyze the power consumption of various mobile devices used in Ventures
-  Estimate the total power consumption and cost of using mobile devices for a month based on the average power rates in India
-  Offer suggestions on how to reduce power consumption and save costs while using mobile devices
-  Provide insights on the impact of mobile device usage on the environment and suggest ways 
to reduce it
-  Continuously update the information and recommendations based on the latest trends and developments in mobile technology and power consumption
CRITICISM:  I need to ensure that my recommendations are accurate and up-to-date. I should also aim to provide simple and practical suggestions that are easy to implement. Additionally, 
I need to be mindful of the cost of using mobile devices and suggest ways to reduce it without compromising on functionality.

 THOUGHTS:  To estimate the power consumption of mobile devices used in Ventures, we need to 
gather information on the power consumption of each device. We can do this by calling the Ventures API to get the power consumption details for each device. Once we have this information, we can calculate the total power consumption and cost of using mobile devices for a month based on the average power rates in India.

"If the user requests for product measurement data or number of available products for laptop or computer or mobile , you should call ventures api with proper format\n"

"API routes - query format - explanation - response format as follows\n"

"/getMeasurementData?product='productType'&user='userName' - productType : string<laptop|computer|mobile> , userName : string - will give the details of the product and user queried in ventures - string\n"

"/getAvailablityData?product='productType'&user='userName' - productType : string<laptop|computer|mobile> , userName : string - will give number of available stocks for that particular of the product and user in ventures - string \n"

"use 'all' to request for all data for a particular query"

"while calling ventures api , the query args in response format should exacty match the query format\n"

```
I want Auto-GPT to: find out how many laptops does viki have in ventures

NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = venture ARGUMENTS = {'query': "/getAvailablityData?product='laptop'&user='Viki'"}

I want Auto-GPT to: find out the total number of latops used by everyone in ventures

NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = venture ARGUMENTS = {'query': "/getMeasurementData?product='laptop'&user='all'"}


```

Drawbacks 
- our prompt engineering was not so good as it requires the ventures keyword to make request to api , i tried 
	- `show me all the products that raghul is using`  , it responded with something like `let me find out if there is any text file called raghul_products.txt ` 
	- but `show me all the products that raghul is using in ventures`  works as expected
