## Topics

- Use assert statements
- Metrics
  - 90<sup>th</sup> percentile
- Test cases
  - Expected user behaviour â€“ happy path testing
  - Corner Cases
  - Is proper error handling done?

## Types of Testing

- White box Testing
- Black box Testing
- Unit Testing
  - Code Coverage
  - Operation mutation
  - Try to make the test fail
  - [Property based testing](https://youtu.be/IYzDFHx6QPY?si=sFn5a3PBlfd9knRD)
    - Random value property based testing
    - Different path, same destination (mapping an array and sorting == sorting an array and mapping)
    - Invert the operation, check for original input (reverse a list two times, you get original one)
  - [Effective Unit Testing](https://youtu.be/fr1E9aVnBxw?si=MAh5aqCtBYBr5SXb)
    - Run quick tests first
    - [Follow TDD](https://youtu.be/vXnTMjMe5Eg?si=GVI9QhWBRAk2RxHH)
      - Write test first
      - Run the test, it should fail
      - Write code to pass the test
    - Avoid test interdependency, run them parallely
- Integration Testing
- End to end Testing
- Performance Testing

## Case Studies

Explore how popular open-source libraries write tests:

- Langchain
  - Folders for unit and integration tests, where app structure is maintained
  - [Langchain test docs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/contributing/testing/)
    - prefers unit tests over integration tests
    - unit tests run on every PR
    - integration tests runs once a day
      - http interaction will be cached using pytest-vcr - [ref](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/contributing/testing/#recording-http-interactions-with-pytest-vcr)
    - llm is mocked while testing agents

## Pytest : Documentaion notes
  - Use builtin temp dir fixture for file paths 
  - Fixture results will be cached in a scope and can be modified  
  - Fixture with params 
  - Overriding fixtures 
  - Config add addopts:--strict-markers  
  - When to use skip and xfail 
    - skip - test cannot run in a env 
    - xfail - expected to fail 
  - Add no_request monkeypatch fixture in conftest 
  - Test running config 
    - `-lf` - runs only failed test 
    - `-ff` - runs failed test first 
    - `-sw` - stops at first failing test 
  - Diff between scope module,package,session? 
  - Hooks vs autouse fixtures?
