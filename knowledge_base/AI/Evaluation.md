identification problem
    - Accuracy
    - precision
    - recall
        - precision and recall is introduced since accuracy will be misleading on skewed datasets
    - F1 score
        - why harmonic mean?

translation problem
    - BLEU : Similar to precision
        - CODEBLUE - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10297
    - ROUGE : Similar to recall
    - Perplexity : How 'surprised' a model is see some words together?
