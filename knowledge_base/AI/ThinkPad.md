# AI

## Chunking

- [5 levels of chunking](https://youtu.be/8OJC21T2SL4?si=ljYjQkVy7MOUtgWT)
- [ChunkViz Tool](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/)

## Evaluation
- Ragas evaluation
- F1 score
- truelens
- llm leaderboard
- autogpt benchmark

## Agent Protocol
- architecture for multi agent communication

## Tokenization â€“ Andrej Karpathy

- Gpt problems where tokenization is the problem, (reverse a string etc)
- Gpt optimized python indentation tokens
- Byte pair encoding
- Separate tokens of end-of-string, system-message, user-message, ai-message
- how to tokenize?

### Memory management

- Microsoft copilot chat - create long term and short term memory from the current conversation
- [memary](https://github.com/kingjulio8238/memary)
- memgpt

## Tutorials
- [openai : survey of techniques to maximize the LLM performance](https://youtu.be/ahnGLM-RC1Y?si=z5rcC6Ex_MiGyghs)

### Let's build the GPT Tokenizer
- [Video](https://youtu.be/zduSFxRajkE?si=SmhGh_SvWjXf5-cp)
- Question: At 34:03, how does he highlight and scroll?

## TODO
- see what's new in agent protocol
- inspect opensource repos - llama-index, langchain
- explore different AI memory management systems - memgpt
- Go through tru-lens repo
- Do a course in deep learning - 1 hr 
- Watch Andrej karpathy tokenization - 1 hr
- Watch Conference, tech talks
- Find ways to use AI in daily workflow
    - Github copilot code review

- explore on openai model metric from playground
    - temperature : softmax temperature
        - [understanding openai's temperature](https://www.coltsteele.com/tips/understanding-openai-s-temperature-parameter)
    - top-p : cumulative probability threshold
        - [top-p temperature table](https://community.openai.com/t/cheat-sheet-mastering-temperature-and-top-p-in-chatgpt-api/172683)
    - frequency penalty
    - presence penalty

## Interesting
- finding AI tools usage in leetcode contest
    - hidden custom instructions are provided when description is copied
    - when those are identified in the generated code while submitting, the code will be rejected

## Anthropic economic index
[blog](https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-anthropic-economic-index)
- analyzed over a million conversations with claude
- main findings
  - most of the users are software engineers (36%)
  - usage slightly leaning towards augumentation rather than automation
  - usage is more common in mid to high pay jobs, not in lowest or highest pay jobs
  - only 4% of the jobs use AI more than 75% of their tasks
    - 36% of jobs have AI usage atleast 25% of their tasks
- how conversations are analyzed
  - using clio : a bot to classify conversations
  - classified conversations into occupational tasks

## claude new features
 - Citations API - https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-citations-api
   - provides source information for each block of generated text
   - under the hood : additional instructions are added in system message
- Model Context protocol - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/mcp
  - similar to agent protocol

## OpenAI response API
 - superset of chat completions API
 - not much useful
  
# explore
- anthropic prompt improver and prompt evaluator
