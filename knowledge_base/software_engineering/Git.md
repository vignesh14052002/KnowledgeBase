## Plugins
[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
[pre commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

## Doubts
- Problem: If I accidentally committed a secret and pushed to repo main branch and after some days everyone started branching out, now how do I remove the commit from history without affecting others (force push will affect others)
- git submodules?
