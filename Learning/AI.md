- Better if Data with Text book dense reasoning rather than novel dense reasoning

- Condensed Knowledge Transfer from LLM to SLM

- Improving model with human feedbacks

 

Tokenization – Andrej karpathy

- Gpt problems where tokenization is the problem, (reverse a string etc)

- Gpt optimized python indentation tokens

- Byte pair encoding

- Seperate tokens of end-of-string, system-message, user-message, ai-message

 

LLama index

- Mock llm
